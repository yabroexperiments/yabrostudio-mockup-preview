> **🛡️ EXTERNAL CODE VETTING PROTOCOL — mandatory, ALL projects
> (Albert, 2026-07-21).** NO external skill / plugin / MCP server /
> package / prompt / workflow enters any environment without passing
> the ECVP pipeline (run via **`/vet <url>`**; full spec in
> `docs/external-code-vetting-protocol.md` in this repo, or
> `~/.claude/docs/` for the global copy). Pipeline: intake
> (true-owner/typosquat check, trust tier) → scan (SkillSpector for
> skills, mcp-scan for MCP, Socket+OSV for packages) → full-file
> analysis (scanners are bypassable — a scan pass alone is NEVER a
> green light) → quarantine test in a secret-free throwaway session →
> merge pinned to exact SHA + row in the project's
> `docs/vetted-external-code.md` registry (present but unlisted =
> unvetted) → monitor (updates are new vettings). Hard rules: secrets
> and unvetted code never meet; unknown author + wants
> network/auth/secrets = automatic reject; Albert reads only
> plain-English GREEN/YELLOW/RED verdicts and makes the go/no-go call.
